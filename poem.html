                <p>
                    In the realm of lavender hues,<br>
                    Where purple reigns, and dreams amuse,<br>
                    There dwells a soul so full of grace,<br>
                    Victoria Bourgeois, a charming embrace. <br><br>
                    
                    With love for cats and moths that glide,<br>
                    And Halloween's enchanting tide,<br>
                    Her heart takes flight with butterflies,<br>
                    In nature's dance, she finds her ties.<br><br>
                    
                    Sweet at sixteen, she shines so bright,<br>
                    A beacon of joy, a guiding light,<br>
                    Her middle name, dear Ronnie, rings,<br>
                    A melody of love it sings.<br><br>
                    
                    In her eyes, the stars align,<br>
                    Reflecting galaxies, divine,<br>
                    With every smile, the world takes heed,<br>
                    For she's the magic that we need.<br><br>
                    
                    In Halloween's mysterious embrace,<br>
                    She finds delight, a haunted place,<br>
                    With pumpkins, bats, and eerie sights,<br>
                    She weaves enchantment in moonlit nights.<br><br>
                    
                    Oh, Victoria, so cute and true,<br>
                    This poem's written just for you,<br>
                    A tribute to your vibrant heart,<br>
                    A masterpiece of love and art.<br><br>
                    
                    May butterflies forever dance,<br>
                    And purple dreams continue to enhance,<br>
                    The beauty of your precious soul,<br>
                    As life's grand tapestry unfolds.<br><br>
                    
                    And as the days and years go by,<br>
                    Know that there's someone standing by,<br>
                    A secret admirer, fond and fond,<br>
                    Who cherishes the bond beyond.<br><br>
                    
                    So on this page, a token, a token,<br>
                    Of admiration unspoken,<br>
                    For you, dear Victoria, are adored,<br>
                    Forever and evermore.<br><br>
